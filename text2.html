                                <h1>Representation of Jews in Christian Art</h1>
                                <div class="space"></div>
                                <p>While Jews produced a fair share of their own art, their primary representation to the world through the arts rested in how they were portrayed by the Christian painter’s brush. This representation took on different forms throughout the years. </p>
                                <p>In the early years of Christianity, Old Testament prophets were often included in Western art, but there was no visibly identifiable physical markers distinguishing them from New Testament Gospels.   However, in eleventh and early twelfth century Medieval Christian artworks Jews were given a distinct visual identity. Iconography like the pointed hat and a beard were used as identifying marks of Jewishness , both of which were artistic inventions and not common among Medieval European Jews.The Jew was given a visual distinction so that a superiority of Christianity over Judaism can be portrayed, with Jews serving as  witnesses to the “truth of Christianity” with their presence in the painting.
                                </p>
                                <p>By the mid-twelfth century (1150 CE) the portrayal of Jews started to shift from mere witnesses to Christianity to demonized enemies of Christianity. We start to see images of Jews Mocking and spearing Jesus. Red and yellow (colors associated with evil) clothing, coins or bags full of money, signs associating the Jew with the devil such as horns, hell, or a demon perched on his shoulder, and the hooked nose gets added to the iconography used to identify Jews. [example] In Renaissance art, we see Jews portrayed in physical caricature and as outright “dark, menacing and ugly”. In his book “Rembrandt's Jews”, Steven Nadler explains it to be “...part of a worldview in which the Jew is not merely morally degenerate, but of a sinisterly different nature altogether”. This physical grotesqueness added another layer of “othering” of the jews, because as Nadler further explains “At the end of the day, a badge, a colored cloak, or a hat can be taken off, but the Jew can never escape his true essence”.  Their ugliness is seen as a mere truth, matched by their “spiritual defects and moral inferiority (not to mention his historical crimes).” 
                                </p>
                                <p>A major shift in the artistic representation of Jews is seen in the Dutch Golden age. In a surprising twist, the previously common physical grotesqueness is replaced with utter plainness and ordinariness, with no iconography specifically reserved for representing Jews.  When jewish symbolical stereotyping is found, such as in drawings containing depictions of Jewish liturgical dress, they may be “fancifully overdrawn”, and depictions of Jewish ritual may be exaggerated and dramatic, but, as Nadler explains, they are “put to work not to demonize but to ennoble a religion and a culture in the toleration of which the Dutch may take pride”. </p>
                                <p>The plainness and ordinariness with which Jews were depicted in the Dutch Golden age was a nice reprieve for the jews, which unfortunately didn’t last long. By the eighteenth, there was a strong resurgence of explicit anti-semitic art. By the 19th century,  Nazi Propaganda, aided by the printing press, succeeded in not only producing, but actively spreading anti-semitic artwork. The trend continues in 2019 with images like a recently printed NY times cartoon depicting a blind skullcap-wearing Donald Trump being lead by a dog-bodied Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, shown with an exaggerated “Jewish” nose.
